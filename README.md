# Democratizing Infrastructure Resilience: A Low-Cost AI-Driven Structural Health Monitoring Framework

## Sustainable Monitoring with AI-Driven Analytics, Commercial Sensors, and Local Capacity Building for Developing Nations with Focus on Sudan

## 📋 Overview

This repository implements a practical, low-cost risk assessment prototype designed for resource-constrained infrastructure in developing nations. It demonstrates how affordable commercial sensors combined with AI-driven analytics can enable effective Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in regions with limited engineering resources.

The system bridges the gap between physics-based structural dynamics (Modal Analysis) and data-driven decision making (Machine Learning), specifically tailored for deployment in Sudan and similar developing nations where traditional high-cost SHM solutions are economically unfeasible.

## 🏛️ Key Research Features

1. **Low-Cost Sensor Integration**: Demonstrates effective SHM using affordable commercial sensors (accelerometers, strain gauges) rather than expensive proprietary systems, making infrastructure monitoring accessible to developing nations.

2. **Physics-Based Data Generation**: Simulates structural damage as shifts in modal parameters (frequencies/damping) and mode shapes, enabling realistic training data without requiring expensive physical testing infrastructure.

3. **Bayesian Risk Assessment**: Implements a Bayesian Sensor Fusion engine that aggregates probabilistic evidence, accounting for sensor reliability - crucial for low-cost sensor networks with varying quality.

4. **Cost-Sensitive Optimization**: Decision thresholds optimized using ROC analysis to minimize expected financial cost, accounting for the economic constraints faced by developing nations.

5. **Edge-Aware Simulation**: Models real-world constraints including battery degradation (solar cycles) and unreliable network connectivity - critical factors in Sudan and similar regions with limited infrastructure.

6. **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Custom engine translates ML predictions into physically grounded narratives, enabling local engineers to understand and trust the system without advanced ML expertise.

7. **Local Capacity Building**: Designed with knowledge transfer in mind, using open-source tools and transparent methodologies that can be maintained by local engineering teams.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system operates as a closed-loop simulation:

1. **Modal Simulator**: Generates spatially-correlated vibration data based on stiffness reduction.
2. **Edge Processor**: Extracts physics-domain features (Welch PSD, Kurtosis) and runs a Calibrated Random Forest.
3. **Fusion Engine**: Aggregates sensor probabilities to update the global health state (Posterior).
4. **Digital Twin Dashboard**: Visualizes the bridge state, uncertainty (Entropy), and "Action Recommendations."
